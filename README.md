# Data-Management-of-Bristol-Air-Quality
The air quality management area in Bristol has been declared due to exceedance of Nitrogen Dioxide annual and hourly objectives and as a precautionary measure, exceedance of objectives for particulate matter (PM10).
This project uses both relational and non relational databases in the analysis and management of Bristol air quality.


# PROJECT BRIEF
# Context: Measuring Air Quality

Levels of various air borne pollutants such as Nitrogen Monoxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO ) and particulate matter (also called particle pollution) are all major contributors to the measure of overall air quality.
For instance, NO is measured using micrograms in each cubic metre of air (㎍/m ). A microgram (㎍) is one millionth of a gram. A concentration of 1 ㎍/m means that one cubic metre of air contains one microgram of pollutant.

To protect our health, the UK Government sets two air quality objectives for NO in their Air Quality Strategy
1. The hourly objective, which is the concentration of NO in the air, averaged over a period of one hour.
2. The annual objective, which is the concentration of NO in the air, averaged over a period of a year.
The following table shows the colour encoding and the levels for Objective 1 above, the mean hourly ratio,
adopted in the UK.
